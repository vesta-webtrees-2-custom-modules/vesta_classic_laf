* The individual page is adjusted further:

    * Less padding between elements
    * The key-value pairs of the name parts are inline

* All edit dialogs are also displayed in a more compact layout.
* Note that this module itself is not a theme: The webtrees user will not be able to switch between the compact and the regular layout! All layout adjustments are globally configurable though.
* Further suggestions are very welcome!

#### Functionality

* The module optionally displays nicknames as in webtrees 1.x (before the surname). See [here](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/issues/1401) for the related discussion.
* The module allows to use xrefs with specific prefixes, as in webtrees 1.x. See [e.g. here](https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/help-for-2-0/33978-identities-in-gedcom-file) for the related discussion.
* The module provides fine-grained configuration options for all GEDCOM tags, as described [here](https://github.com/vesta-webtrees-2-custom-modules/vesta_common/blob/master/docs/GEDCOMTags.md).
